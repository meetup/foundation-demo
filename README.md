# foundation-demo

## Install

`rbenv` isn't required, but [recommended](https://gist.github.com/akdetrick/7604130).
If you're using a mac laptop, you'll most likely be fine without it. To get this project
up and running, use this one liner to clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:meetup/foundation-demo.git; ./setup.sh
```
